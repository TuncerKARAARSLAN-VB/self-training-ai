Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly entered our lives and continues to evolve at an astonishing pace. To keep up with these developments and gain a deeper understanding of the work being done globally in this field, I have decided to continually update myself and actively engage in AI technologies. My goal is not just to appear knowledgeable but to truly understand and apply what I learn.

AI covers a broad spectrum of disciplines and offers applications in various fields, such as image processing, natural language processing, robotics, autonomous systems, and finance. Each area encompasses numerous subfields and specialized applications. My approach is to grasp these areas thoroughly and comprehend how different technologies provide solutions to specific problems.

**My aim** is not only to advance my own learning but also to share the knowledge and experiences I gain along the way, contributing to a broader community. By documenting my study notes, challenges, solutions, and the technologies I learn, I plan to create a resource that can guide others interested in AI. This way, anyone who wants to work in this field can benefit from the materials I prepare.

The developments in AI affect not only technology professionals but also people across all sectors. AI applications are driving transformations in healthcare, education, finance, automotive, and many other industries. Therefore, I aim to create comprehensive and accessible resources for those who want to understand AI technologies and be part of this transformation.

I hope you find my work helpful and that it supports you on your own AI journey.
